# NSManagedObjectModel
1. is a schema to describe your application’s entities, their properties, and the relationships between them
2. A managed object model allows Core Data to map from records in a persistent store to managed objects that you use in your application.
3. The model is a collection of entity description objects (instances of `NSEntityDescription`).

# Entity
1. can think of as a table in a database
2. a subclass of `NSManagedObject`

## Abstract Entities
1. 抽象实体有通用的属性，不会创建实例
2. 抽象实体也要生成对应的类，子类继承这个类
3. 继承自同一抽象实体的实体，存在一张表里面，这个因素可能导致性能问题

## Attributes and Relationships

1. An entity’s properties are its attributes and relationships, including its fetched properties (if it has any).
2. each property has a name and a type
3. 实体的属性的名字不能和`NSObject`或者`NSManagedObject`的无参数的方法名相同，例如`description`
4. Transient attributes
    - as part of the model, but that are not saved to the persistent store as part of an entity instance’s data
    - Core Data does track changes you make to transient properties, so they are recorded for undo operations.
    - You use transient properties for a variety of purposes, including keeping calculated values and derived values.
### Attributes
1.  string, date, and integer (represented as instances of NSString, NSDate, and NSNumber respectively)
2. You can specify that an attribute is optional—that is, it is not required to have a value
    - 尽量避免这样做，特别对于numeric values，尽量使用默认值
    - 避免使用的原因是，SQL has special comparison behavior for NULL that is unlike Objective-C’s nil。
    - NULL在数据库中代表者没有设置任何值
### Relationships and Fetched Properties
1. to-one
    - a single object (or nil if the relationship can be optional) is returned.
2. to-many
    - a set is returned (or again, nil if the relationship can be optional).
3. fetched properties
    - represent weak, one-way relationships.
4. many-to-many
    - create two to-many relationships and then set them up as inverses of each other
5. Inverse
    - to create a fully bidirectional relationship
